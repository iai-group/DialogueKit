.. todo:: Update figure to show only the main concepts listed below.

Participant 
-----------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.participant.participant`

Agents and users are the participants in a dialog. Generally, it is assumed that the agent is a conversational system and the user is a human.
However, the agent might be played by a human ("Wizard-of-Oz") and the human user might be simulated.

DialogueKit assumes the agent to always start the conversation and also end it. (A user can initialize ending a conversation, but the responsibility lies on the agent to actually stop it.)

Agent
-----
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.participant.agent`

Represents a conversational agent with some intelligent capabilities (typically defined by the dialogue policy, natural language understanding, and natural language generation components).

DialogueKit is shipped with some sample agents (**TODO:** reference sample agents page). These are described below:

.. todo:: Move these to a separate sample_agents module outside dialoguekit (https://github.com/iai-group/DialogueKit/issues/153)

* **ParrotAgent**: This agent will welcome the user, but will always parrot (echo) what the user says.

* **RasaParrotAgent**: This agent looks like the **ParrotAgent** to the user, but is actually just a connector to a Rasa conversational agent. This conversational agent is also part of DialogueKit

* **MovieBotAgent**: A connector agent for `IAI MovieBot <https://github.com/iai-group/moviebot>`_ .

* **WozAgent**: Allows a real human to play the role of the agent ("wizard") when interacting with a user. This can be useful, e.g., when testing user simulators.

User 
----
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.participant.user`

Represents a human interacting with an agent in natural language text.

Utterance
---------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.utterance`

Dialogue participants exchange utterances, which are represented as raw text. To store intent, annotations, or freely definable metadata associated with utterances, :py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.annotated_utterance` should be used.

Intent 
--------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.intent`

The intent represents the action expressed by a participant in an utterance. For example, an agent asking the question *"Do you like pizza?"* may have the intent to *INQUIRE* a preference from the user.

Platform 
--------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.platforms.platform`

The platform's responsibility is to facilitate the conversation. DialogueKit includes a simple terminal-based platform. However, it can support other platforms by facilitating communication via POST requests. 

Dialogue Connector 
----------------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.connector.dialogue_connector`

Holds and orchestrates the conversation between the participants.

Domain 
------
:py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.domain`

Defines the types of entities and the set of properties ("slots") for each entity type.

Annotations
-----------
There are two types of annotations

* **Intent** :py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.intent`: represents the dialogue action.
* **SlotValueAnnotation** :py:mod:`dialoguekit.core.slot_value_annotation`: slot-value pairs, where a slot refers to an entity or a property in the domain.


User preferences
----------------

* Preferences are expressed for specific slot-value pairs, where slots correspond to entities or properties in the domain.
