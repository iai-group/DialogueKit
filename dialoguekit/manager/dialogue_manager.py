"""Central broker for coordinating the communication between Agent and User.

The DialogueManager is instantiated with an Agent and a User.  These are then
connected with the particular DialogueManager instance by calling their
respective `connect_dialogue_manager()` methods.

By definition, the communication starts with the Agent's welcome message.
Each agent/user utterance is sent to the other party via their respective
`receive_utterance()` methods.
It is left to to specific Agent and User instances when and how they respond.
It is expected that most will respond immediately upon receiving an utterance,
but this is not required.  Whenever there is a message from either the Agent or
the User, the DialogueManager sends it to the other party by calling their
`receive_{agent/user}_utterance()` method.
