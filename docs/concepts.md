# Main concepts

  * **Participant**
    - Represents a participant in the conversation.
    - **User** and **Agent** are Participants
  * **Agent**
    - Represents a bot, with its own set of logic, **NLU** and **NLG**.
  * **User**
    - Represents a human interacting. Has the simplest form of interaction, which are strings to and from the **Dialogue Manager**.
  * **Utterance**
    - An **utterance** by an **Agent** or **User**. The utterance holds the participant utterance as clear text and can hold additionally to the intent and or annotation.
  * **Platform**
    - The platform is the way the **Participants** communicate with each other. This can be native to DialogueKit or other forms as REST APIs or other methods.
  * **Dialogue Manager**
    - Holds and orchestrates the conversation between the participants.
  * **Ontology**
    - Defines the types of entities and the set of properties ("slots") for each entity type.
  * There are two types of annotations
    - **Intent**: represents the dialogue action.
    - **SlotValueAnnotation**: slot-value pairs, where a slot refers to an entity or a property in the **ontology**.
  * **User preferences**
    - Preferences are expressed for specific slot-value pairs, where slots correspond to **entities** or properties in the **ontology**.

## Concepts specific to item recommendation scenarios

  * Item: an entity with a unique ID, canonical name, and any number of properties (represented as property-value pairs, where properties correspond to ontology classes).
  * ItemCollection: a collection of items.
  * Ratings: explicit user preferences on items (normalized into [-1,1]).
